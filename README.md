This repo contains the results of writing an oracle for the "Freeway"
environment from OpenAI Gym.  

There are two sets of data here:

1. 25 full runs with different seeds.  Each run is in the
   directory `From-Beginning` in the file `Path-Seed.txt`.
   The format of each file is one line per action:

```
[time,Y] action [time,Y]
```

2. 10,000 single crossings.  These are in the file
   `Single-Crossings.txt`.  Each line of the file contains 
   information for an optimal crossing of the street:

```
seed starting_time actions
````

These were generated by setting the seed, rolling forward to the starting
time by performing the "stay put" action (action number 0) *starting_time-1$
times.
